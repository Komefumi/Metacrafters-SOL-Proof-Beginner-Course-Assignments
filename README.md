# Solana SOL-Proof Beginner-Course Module-2 Airdrop Challenge

This repostiory features a modified form of the code used in the beginning of Module 2, of [Metacrafter Academy's](https://academy.metacrafters.io/) SOL Proof: Beginner Course.

You get to perform airdropping on a solana wallet, that you specify by public key.

Note that airdropping happens on devnet. No real SOL is spent.

Usage from within project directory:

```bash
node index.js <public-key>
```

Ensure node.js is installed, and dependencies are installed via a package manager of your choice (npm, yarn, pnpm, so on)
